Installing BANDIT on the HOST system
====================================

In the following commands replace <latest> with the latest version available.
See also https://phy.wiki/doc/Install_BANDIT_on_a_Linux_HOST_system

Download the latest released version of BANDIT from ftp://phyglos.org/bandit
$ wget ftp://phyglos.org/bandit/bandit-<latest>.tar.gz 
$ tar xvf bandit-<latest>.tar.gz

Optionally, rename the BANDIT directory when needed:
$ mv bandit-<latest> bandit

Alternatively, clone from the github.com repository to get the development master branch.
$ git clone https://github.com/phyglos/bandit

As root, move the file to /opt and change into that directory
# mv bandit /opt
# cd /opt
# chown -R root.root /opt/bandit

Initialize the HOST environment for BANDIT from the bandit home directory:
# cd bandit
# source bandit.env

Bandit should work now in the HOST. Test with:
# bandit --version

To get help about all bandit options, issue:
# bandit --help
