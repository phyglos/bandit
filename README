Getting started
===============

The Build AND Install Toolkit, or the BANDIT, is a software toolkit used
to build and install new software functionality into a GNU/Linux system.

The BANDIT is the equivalent of a package manager in other Linux distributions
for the phy GNU/Linux operating system. It is the component responsible for
building and installing new software in the system. In addition to that,
the BANDIT can also create a new TARGET system aside the HOST system and
install the phyglos distribution on it.

The toolkit is written as a set of pure GNU Bash scripts. This allows the BANDIT
to be installed in a variety of hosts systems regardless of their different
GNU/Linux flavour or processorâ€™s architecture.

When installed in a Linux distribution other than phyglos, like Debian or Fedora,
it is normally used to raise a new phyglos machine. However, on these distros
the BANDIT can also be used independently to install software in parallel to
the main package manager.


How to use
==========

The INSTALL file describes how to install BANDIT in the HOST system. 

Status
======

The BANDIT is in STABLE status. The toolkit is capable of building and installing
a new phy system from a HOST system running Debian, Fedora or phyglos. The BANDIT
is able to manage software bundles on a phy system.
