The template catalog
====================

The "template" catalog is a template for an empty catalog with an empty bundle 
provided with the BANDIT toolkit.

This template is used to create a new empty catalog or bundle in your local system 
when using the create verb in BANDIT commands like:

# bandit -c some-catalog create
# bandit -b some-bundle create
